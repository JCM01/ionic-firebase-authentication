# This is a service integration of my project an ionic-firebase-authentication fully working!

I'm developing an app with Ionic-Angular to create my project about pet adoption to reunite owners that can't take care any more of their pets and pet shelters, so users can adopt pets easier than before. 

This is part one of my project a Login, Register with an Email-Verification, Password Reset, Login with Google and a Sign-out button. 

My logo is a PNG image with movement up and down using CSS animation ease-in-out.

The data stores in local Storage as User in Firebase only verify accounts as Gmail and accounts who register as normal email stays in Authentication including Gmail accounts.
